  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview>
      <h:p>
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access System (AS) in terms of <xref g="CC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Network Device collaborative Protection Profile (NDcPP) Version 2.2e</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      This Base-PP is valid because a WLAN AS is a device at the edge of a private network that establishes an encrypted IEEE 802.11 link that protects wireless data in transit from disclosure and modification. 
      A network device typically implements this functionality.
      </h:p>
      <!-- 
	   post-process.py cannot find find "access points" and thus will attempt to define
	   AP when it finds it.
      -->
      <h:span style="display:none">Access Point (AP)</h:span>
      <h:p>
      A TOE that conforms to a PP-Configuration containing this PP-Module must be a ‘Distributed TOE’ as
      defined in the NDcPP.
      The expectation for this PP-Module is that a WLAN AS must include a controller and one or more access points (APs).

        This PP-Module specifically addresses WLAN (IEEE 802.11) ASes. A compliant WLAN AS is a
        system composed of hardware and software that is connected to a network and has an infrastructure
        role in the overall enterprise network. In particular, a WLAN AS establishes a secure wireless
        (IEEE 802.11) link that provides an authenticated and encrypted path to an enterprise network and
        thereby decreases the risk of exposure of information transiting “over-the-air”.
	</h:p>
	<h:p>
        Since this PP-Module extends the NDcPP, conformant TOEs are obligated to implement the functionality
        required in the NDcPP along with the additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in
	response to the threat environment discussed subsequently herein.

  <sec:Security_Problem_Description>
    <h:p>
    This PP-Module is written to address the situation when network packets cross the boundary
    between a wired private network and a wireless client via a WLAN AS. The WLAN Access
    System provides secure communication between a user (wireless client) and a wired (trusted) network
    by supporting security functions such as administration, authentication, encryption, and the protection
    and handling of data in transit.
    To protect the data in transit from disclosure and modification, a WLAN
    AS is used to establish secure communications. The WLAN AS provides one end
    of the secure cryptographic tunnel and performs encryption and decryption of network packets in
    accordance with a WLAN AS security policy negotiated with its authenticated wireless client.
    It supports multiple simultaneous wireless connections and is capable of establishing and terminating
    multiple cryptographic tunnels to and from those peers.</h:p>
    <h:p>
    
    The proper installation, configuration, and administration of the WLAN AS are critical to its
    correct operation.</h:p>

    <h:p>
      Note that this PP-Module does not repeat the threats identified in the NDcPP,
      though they all apply given the conformance and hence dependence of this PP-Module on the NDcPP.
      Note also that while the NDcPP contains only threats to the ability of the TOE to provide its
      security functions, this PP-Module addresses only threats to resources in the Operational Environment (OE).
      Together the threats of the NDcPP and those defined in this PP-Module define the comprehensive set of
      security threats addressed by a WLAN AS TOE.

                <h:p>
                  This requirement is modified from its definition in the NDcPP by mandating the selection of
		  CBC mode and 256 bit key sizes while also defining additional AES mode and key size selections
		  not present in the original definition.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  This requirement mandates two modes for AES with a key size of 256 bits being implemented.
		  It is not expected that these modes will both be used for all encryption and decryption functionality.
		  Rather, the mandates serve particular purposes: to comply with the FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 requirements,
		  CBC mode is mandated, and to comply with IEEE 802.11-2020, AES-CCMP
		  (which uses AES in CCM as specified in SP 800-38C) must be implemented.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  For the first selection of FCS_COP.1.1/DataEncryption, the ST author should choose the additional mode or modes in which AES operates.
		  For the second selection, the ST author should choose the key sizes that are supported by this functionality.
		  256-bit CCMP is required in order to comply with FCS_CKM.1/WPA.
		  Note that optionally AES-CCMP-192, AES-CCMP-128, AES-GCMP-192, and AES-GCMP-128 with cryptographic key size of 256 bits, may be implemented for IEEE 802.11ax-2021 connections.
		  In the future, one of these modes may be required.
		</h:p>

                  CTR mode is not used for WLAN AS capabilities but remains selectable since it may be required by another part of the TSF.

		  In addition to the tests required by the NDcPP, the evaluator will perform the following testing:
		<h:p>
                  <h:b>AES-CCM Tests</h:b></h:p>
		  <h:p>
                  The evaluator will test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths:</h:p>
		  <h:p>
                  <h:b>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:b></h:p>
		  <h:p>
                  <h:b>Two payload lengths</h:b>. One payload length will be the shortest supported payload length,
                  greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length will be the longest supported
                  payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).</h:p>
		  <h:p>
                    <h:b>Two or three associated data lengths</h:b>.
		    One associated data length will be 0, if supported.
		    One associated data length will be the shortest supported payload length,
		    greater than or equal to
                    zero bytes.
		    One associated data length will be the longest supported payload length, less than
                    or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).
		    If the implementation supports an associated data length of 216
                    bytes, an associated data length of 216 bytes will be tested.
		  </h:p>
		  <h:p>
                    <h:b>Nonce lengths</h:b>.
		    All supported nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes, inclusive, will be tested.
		  </h:p>
		  <h:p>
                    <h:b>Tag lengths</h:b>.
		    All supported tag lengths of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 bytes will be tested.
		  </h:p>
		  <h:p>
                    Due to the restrictions that IEEE 802.11 specifies for this mode
		    (nonce length of 13 and tag length of 8),
                    it is acceptable to test a subset of the supported lengths as long as the selections
		    fall into the ranges specified above.
		    In this case, the evaluator will ensure that these are the only supported lengths.
                    To test the generation-encryption functionality of AES-CCM, the evaluator will
		    perform the following four tests:
		  </h:p>
		  <h:p>
                  <testlist>
                    <test>For each supported key and associated data length and any supported payload, nonce
                      and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value and 10 pairs of
                      associated data and payload values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.</test>
                    <test>For each supported key and payload length and any supported associated data, nonce
                      and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value and 10 pairs of
                      associated data and payload values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.</test>
                    <test>For each supported key and nonce length and any supported associated data, payload,
                      and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value and 10 associated data, payload and
                      nonce value 3-tuples, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.</test>
                    <test>For each supported key and tag length and any supported associated data, payload, and
                      nonce length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value and 10 pairs of
                      associated data and payload values and, obtain the resulting ciphertext</test>
                  </testlist>
                  To determine correctness in each of the above tests, the evaluator will compare the ciphertext with the
                  result of generation-encryption of the same inputs with a known good implementation.</h:p>
		  <h:p>
                  To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for each combination of supported
                  associated data length, payload length, nonce length, and tag length, the evaluator will supply a key
                  value and 15 nonce, associated data and ciphertext 3-tuples, and obtain either a fail result or a pass
                  result with the decrypted payload.
		  The evaluator will supply 10 tuples that should fail and 5 that should pass per set of 15.
		  </h:p>
		  <h:p>
                  Additionally, the evaluator will use tests from the IEEE 802.11-02/362r6 document “Proposed Test

		The cryptographic key derivation algorithm required by IEEE 802.11-2020 (Section
		12.7.1.2) and verified in WPA2 certification is PRF-384, which uses the HMAC-SHA-1 function and
		outputs 384 bits.
		The use of GCMP is defined in IEEE 802.11ax-2021 (Section 12.5.5) and
		requires a
		Key Derivation Function (KDF) based on HMAC-SHA-256 (for 128-bit symmetric keys) or HMAC-SHA-384 (for 256-bit symmetric keys).
		This KDF outputs 704 bits.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		This requirement applies only to the keys that are generated or derived for the communications
		between the AP and the client once the client has been authenticated.
		It refers to the derivation of the Group Temporal Key (GTK),
		through the Random Bit Generator (RBG) specified in this PP-Module,
		as well as the derivation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) from the Pairwise Master Key (PMK),
		which is done using a random value generated by the RBG specified in this PP-Module,
		the HMAC function as specified in this PP-Module, as well as other information.
		This is specified in IEEE 802.11-2020, primarily in chapter 12.

		  The cryptographic primitives will be verified through evaluation activities specified elsewhere in this PP-Module.
                The evaluator will verify that the TSS describes how the primitives defined and implemented by this PP-Module
                are used by the TOE in establishing and maintaining secure connectivity to the wireless clients. This
                description will include how the GTK and PTK are generated or derived. The TSS will also provide a
                description of the developer’s methods of assuring that their implementation conforms to the
                cryptographic standards; this includes not only testing done by the developing organization, but also
                proof of third-party testing that is performed (e.g. WPA2 certification). The evaluator will ensure that
                the description of the testing methodology is of sufficient detail to determine the extent to which the
                details of the protocol specifics are tested.<h:br/><h:br/>

              <Guidance>There are no guidance evaluation activities for this component.<h:br/><h:br/></Guidance>
              <Tests>
		  The evaluator will perform the following test using a packet sniffing tool to collect
		  frames between the TOE and a wireless client:
		<h:p>
                  Step 1: The evaluator will configure the AP to an unused channel and configure the WLAN
                  sniffer to sniff only on that channel (i.e., lock the sniffer on the selected channel).
		  The sniffer should also be configured to filter on the MAC address of the TOE and client.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  Step 2: The evaluator will configure the TOE to communicate with a WLAN client using IEEE 
                  802.11-2020 and a 256-bit (64 hex values 0-f) pre-shared key,
		  setting up the connections as described in the operational guidance.
		  The pre-shared key is only used for testing.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  Step 3: The evaluator will start the sniffing tool, initiate a connection between the
		  TOE and WLAN client, and allow the TOE to authenticate, associate, and successfully
		  complete the four-way handshake with the client.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  Step 4: The evaluator will set a timer for one minute, at the end of which the evaluator
		  will disconnect the client from the TOE and stop the sniffer.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  Step 5: The evaluator will identify the four-way handshake frames (denoted EAPOL-key in Wireshark
                  captures) and derive the PTK from the four-way handshake frames and pre-shared key as specified
		  in IEEE 802.11-2020.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  Step 6: The evaluator will select the first data frame from the captured packets that was
		  sent between the client and TOE after the four-way handshake successfully completed
		  and without the frame control value 0x4208 (the first two bytes are 08 42).
		  The evaluator will use the PTK to decrypt the data portion of the packet as specified in
		  IEEE 802.11-2020 and verify that the decrypted data contains ASCII-readable text.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
                  Step 7: The evaluator will repeat Step 6 for the next two data frames between the TOE and client,
		  and without frame control value 0x4208.

                  Additionally, the evaluator will test the PRF function using the test vectors from:

	      <h:p>
            This requirement covers the TOE's role as the authenticator in an 802.1X
            authentication exchange. If the exchange is completed successfully, the TOE will obtain the PMK from
            the RADIUS server and perform the four-way handshake with the wireless client (supplicant) to begin
            802.11 communications.</h:p>
	    <h:p>
            As indicated previously, there are at least three communication paths present during the exchange; two
            with the TOE as an endpoint and one with the TOE acting as a transfer point only.
	    The TOE establishes an EAP over Local Area Network (EAPOL) connection with the wireless
	    client as specified in 802.1X-2007.
	    The TOE also establishes (or has established) a RADIUS protocol connection protected either
	    by IPsec or RadSec (TLS) with the RADIUS server. 
            The wireless client and RADIUS server establish an EAP-TLS session
            (RFC 5216); in this transaction the TOE merely takes the EAP-TLS packets from its EAPOL/RADIUS
            endpoint and transfers them to the other endpoint. Because the specific authentication method (TLS in
            this case) is opaque to the TOE, there are no requirements with respect to RFC 5126 in this PP-Module.
            However, the base RADIUS protocol (2865) has an update (3579) that will need to be addressed in the
            implementation and evaluation activities. Additionally, RFC 5080 contains implementation issues that
            will need to be addressed by developers but which levy no new requirements.</h:p>
	    <h:p>
            
            The point of performing 802.1X authentication is to provide access to the network (assuming the
            authentication was successful and that all 802.11 negotiations are performed successfully); in the
            terminology of 802.1X, this means the wireless client has access to the "controlled port" maintained by
            the TOE.

                In order to show that the TSF implements the 802.1X-2010 standard correctly, the evaluator will ensure
                that the TSS contains the following information: <h:ul>
                <h:li>The sections (clauses) of the standard that the TOE implements</h:li>
                <h:li>For each identified section, any options selected in the implementation allowed by the
                standards are specified</h:li>
                <h:li>For each identified section, any non-conformance is identified and described, including a
                justification for the non-conformance</h:li>
                </h:ul>
                Because the connection to the RADIUS server will be contained in an IPsec or RadSec (TLS) tunnel,
                the security mechanisms detailed in the RFCs identified in the requirement are not relied on to provide
                protection for these communications. Consequently, no extensive analysis of the RFCs is required.
                However, the evaluator will ensure that the TSS describes the measures (documentation, testing) that
                are taken by the product developer to ensure that the TOE conforms to the RFCs listed in this
                requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>

                <testlist>
                  <test>The evaluator will demonstrate that a wireless client has no access to the test network. After
                    successfully authenticating with a RADIUS server through the TOE, the evaluator will demonstrate that

                  <test>The evaluator will demonstrate that a wireless client has no access to the test network. The

                <h:b>Note: </h:b>Tests 2 and 3 above are not tests that "EAP-TLS works," although that is a by-product of the test.
                The test is actually that a failed authentication (under two failure modes) results in denial of access to
                the network, which demonstrates the enforcement of FIA_8021X_EXT.1.3.

              When the TSF negotiates a TLS_RSA_PSK cipher suite, the TSF shall verify that the presented identifier matches the reference identifier per RFC 6125 section 6.
            </title>
            <note role="application">
	      <h:p>
	      This requirement must be claimed if any ciphersuites beginning with 'TLS_RSA_PSK' are selected in FCS_RADSEC_EXT.2.1.</h:p>
	      <h:p>
              The rules for verification of identity are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125. 
              The reference identifier is typically established by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of the authentication server). 
              Based on a singular reference identifier’s source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), 
              the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name for the Subject Alternative Name field. 
              The client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the TLS server’s certificate.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. 
              Verification using the Common Name is required for the purposes of backwards compatibility. 
              Additionally, support for use of IP addresses in the Subject Name or Subject Alternative name is discouraged as against best practices but may be implemented. 
              Finally, support for wildcards is discouraged but may be implemented. 
              If the client supports wildcards, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity.

	      <h:p>
		For the length of the text-based pre-shared keys, a common length (22 characters) is required to help
		promote interoperability.
		If other lengths are supported, they should be listed in the assignment;
		this assignment can also specify a range of values (e.g., "lengths from 5 to 55 characters") as well.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		For <xref to="fel-get-psk"/>, the ST author specifies whether the TSF merely accepts bit-based pre-shared keys
		or is capable of generating them.
		If it generates them, the requirement specifies that they must be
		generated using the RBG provided by the TOE.
	      </h:p>
          </note>
          <aactivity>
	    <TSS>
	      The evaluator will verify that the TSS describes 
	      <h:ol>
		<h:li>the protocols that can use pre-shared keys and that these are consistent with the selections made in <xref to="fel-use-psk"/>.</h:li>
		<h:li>the allowable values for pre-shared keys and that they are consistent with the selections made in <xref to="fel-valid-psk"/>.</h:li>
		<h:li>the way bit-based pre-shared keys are procured and that it is consistent with the selections made in <xref to="fel-get-psk"/>.</h:li>
	      </h:ol>
	    </TSS>
              <Guidance>
		  The evaluator will examine the operational guidance to determine that it provides guidance to
                administrators on the composition of strong text-based pre-shared keys, and (if the selection indicates
                keys of various lengths can be entered) that it provides information on the range of lengths supported.
                The guidance must specify the allowable characters for pre-shared keys, and that list must be a superset of the list contained in FIA_PSK_EXT.1.2.<h:br/><h:br/>
                The evaluator will confirm the operational guidance contains instructions for either entering bit-based
                pre-shared keys for each protocol identified in the requirement or for generating a bit-based pre-shared
                key (or both).<h:br/><h:br/>
	      </Guidance>
              <Tests>The evaluator will also perform the following tests for each protocol (or instantiation of a protocol, if
                performed by a different implementation on the TOE). Note that one or more of these tests can be
                performed with a single test case.
                <testlist>
                  <test>The evaluator will compose a pre-shared key of 22 characters that contains a combination of
                    the allowed characters in accordance with the operational guidance and demonstrates that a successful
                    protocol negotiation can be performed with the key.
                  </test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE supports pre-shared keys of multiple lengths, the evaluator will repeat
                    Test 1 using the minimum length; the maximum length; a length inside the allowable range; and invalid
                    lengths beyond the supported range (both higher and lower). The minimum, maximum, and included
                    length tests should be successful, and the invalid lengths must be rejected by the TOE.
                  </test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE does not generate bit-based pre-shared keys, the evaluator will obtain a
                    bit-based pre-shared key of the appropriate length and enter it according to the instructions in the
                    operational guidance. The evaluator will then demonstrate that a successful protocol negotiation can
                    be performed with the key.</test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE does generate bit-based pre-shared keys, the evaluator will generate a
                    bit-based pre-shared key of the appropriate length and use it according to the instructions in the
                    operational guidance. The evaluator will then demonstrate that a successful protocol negotiation can
                    be performed with the key.

    This PP-Module has no implicitly satisfied requirements. All SFR dependencies are explicitly met either through SFRs defined by the PP-Module or inherited from the Base-PP.

  <appendix title="Allocation of Requirements in Distributed TOEs" id="allocation">
    
    For a distributed TOE, the security functional requirements in this PP-Module need to be met by the
    TOE as a whole, but not all SFRs will necessarily be implemented by all components. The
    following categories are defined in order to specify when each SFR must be implemented by a
    component: <h:ul>
      <h:li><h:b>All Components ("All")</h:b> —All components that comprise the distributed TOE must
        independently satisfy the requirement.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>At least one Component ("One")</h:b> —This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one
        component within the distributed TOE.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>Feature Dependent ("Feature Dependent")</h:b> — These requirements will only be
        fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the distributed TOE component (note
        that the requirement to meet the PP-Module as a whole requires that at least one component
        implements these requirements if they are claimed by the TOE).</h:li></h:ul>
    The table below specifies how each of the SFRs in this PP-Module must be met, using the categories above.
